# simple-streamlit-app

## Welcome to my streamlit app!

This is a small python project to show how easy it is to use the streamlit python library to deploy simple apps through your git hub account :)
Streamlit documentation is easily found through Google.

All you need is to install the python library using the requirements.txt file (preferrably install it into a python virtual environment as best practice)
